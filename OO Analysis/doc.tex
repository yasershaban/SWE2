\section{System Description}
  \hspace{0.5cm} This is a \textit{Freelancing Management System}, a system which
  allows \textit{Customers } and \textit{Freelancers} to find
  one--another easily. It manages the processes from finding workers,
  verifying them, engaging, paying up to rating.
  \hspace{0.3cm}Let us take you on an interesting tour into the
  \textit{system actors}, every one of them sees the system differently
  according to their role.

\section{System Actors}
\subsection{Root}
\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{The Root} is the owner of the system. He is the one
who set it up for the first time with a special root access from him.
The Root also specifies the system settings like penalties,
bonuses on the rate and ratio of the profit on each Employer-Freelancer deal. \\
Besides, He add \textit{Admins} to manage the system.









\subsection{Admin}
\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Admins} are the managers of the system. They have
\textit{The managers access} over the hole system, they can \textit{delete}
or \textit{ban} any consumer account. \\
Also, They can view some Statistics like the number of the Employers and
Freelancer. They can \textit{Receive} and \textit{Reply Complaints} of the
consumers as well. \\Admins can view reports about the system
 i.e \textit{economic}, \textit{consumers}, \textit{blocked}, ...   reports.

\subsection{Freelancer}
\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Freelancers} are the workers of the system.
Every one them have an \textit{Profile} where he can share his experience,
and work examples. His \textit{Profile} contains enough information
so that the Employer can decide wherever he is going to invest in that
\textit{freelancer} or not.
There is a \textit{Rate} in the \textit{Freelancers Profile} is computed
with very accurate algorithms based on the \textit{Employers Feedback}
and how commitment is the Freelancer!
\textit{Freelancer} are paid per hour, and it is in the \textit{profile}.
A \textit{Freelancer} can review the \textit{Employers' Profiles} and
their \textit{Tasks} which they can apply for it and make special offers
for the \textit{Employers}.


\subsection{Employer}
\hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Employer} are the stockholders. They also have
their \textit{profiles}. An \textit{Employer} can create a \textit{Task} or
\textit{a list of tasks} seen  by interested \textit{Freelancers}.
Then the \textit{Employer} can choose the best \textit{Freelancer} among who
applied. Once the \textit{Employer} accepts the \textit{offer}
the money is \textit{withdrawn} from his account to the pending state in
the system. After the \textit{task} is finished, the \textit{Employer} can
\textit{rate} and \textit{feedback} the \textit{freelancer},
and sure the freelancer is paid.
